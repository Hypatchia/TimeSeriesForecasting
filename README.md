* In this repository, I have included a variety of time series forecasting models and related projects. These projects demonstrate my skills and experience in this domain. You can find the following files and projects:

## Projects:
* **ARIMA.R**: This script contains an implementation of the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for time series forecasting.
It's a great choice for straightforward time series data.
* **SeasonalARIMA.r**:
An extended version of ARIMA that includes seasonal components for more accurate forecasting. Useful for data with clear seasonal patterns.

* **TimeSeriesDecomposition.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook showcases time series decomposition techniques to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals. It's a valuable tool for data exploration and understanding.

* **TseriesAnalysis.ipynb** : This project provides a comprehensive analysis of time series data using Python, including data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis.
* **TseriesForecastingRNNs.ipynb**: An example of using Recurrent Neural Networks specifically LSTMs for time series forecasting, the deep learning approach for complex data patterns.

## Dependencies:
* R
* Python, Tensorflow, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,

## Instructions
* Clone repo
~~~
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timeseries-forecasting.git
